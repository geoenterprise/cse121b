/* W02-Task - Profile Home Page */

/* Step 1 - Setup type tasks - no code required */

/* Step 2 - Variables */

        // Declare and instantiate a variable to hold your name. Identify the variable as "fullName".
const fullName = "Jovanny Rey";

        //Declare and instantiate a variable to hold the current year. Identify the variable as "currentYear"
const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();

        //Declare and instantiate a variable to hold the file path (location) and file name of the image that you placed in the images folder as a string. Identify the variable as "profilePicture".
const profilePicture = "images/MyProfilePic.jpg";

/* Step 3 - Element Variables */

        //Use the document.getElementById() method to get the HTML element with the id of name and store it in a const variable named "nameElement".
const nameElement = document.getElementById("name");

        //Use the document.getElementById() method to get the HTML element with the id of food and store it in a const variable named "foodElement".
const foodElement = document.getElementById("food");

        //Use the document.querySelector() method to get the element with the id of "year" and store it in a variable named "yearElement".
const yearElement = document.querySelector("#year");

        //Use any viable method to get the profile image element stored into a variable named "imageElement".
const imageElement = document.querySelector("img");

/* Step 4 - Adding Content */

        //Assign the nameElement's innerHTML property the fullName variable value.
        //Surround the fullName value with <strong> tags.
nameElement.innerHTML = `<strong>${fullName}</strong>`;

        //Use the textContent property to set the value of the element to the value of the variable currentYear.
yearElement.textContent = currentYear;
    
        //Use the setAttribute method to set the src property of the image element and set its value to the file path variable set in Step 2.
imageElement.setAttribute("src", profilePicture);

        //Use the setAttribute method to set the alt property of the image element and set its value to equal 'Profile image of [Insert Name Variable]' where the name variable comes from Step 2. Always use a template literal to create the string.
imageElement.setAttribute("alt", `This is ${fullName}. A software developer from BYU-Idaho.`);

/* Step 5 - Array */
        //Declare an array variable to hold your favorite foods
let favfood = ["Hamburguers", "Pizza", "Steak", "Eggs", "Mango", "Rice", "Shrimp", "Fettuccine Alfredo", "Ajiaco", "Mondongo", "Bacon"];

        //Modify the HTML element with the id of food to display your favorite foods array. ðŸ’¡Remember that you set a variable named foodElement in Step 3 to reference the element with the id of food.
foodElement.innerHTML = favfood;

        //Declare and instantiate a variable to hold another single favorite food item.
let newfood = "Lulada";

        //Add the value stored in this new variable to your favorite food array
favfood.push(newfood);

        //Append the new array values onto the displayed content of the HTML element with the id of food using a += operator and a <br> (line break character) to provide a line break as shown in Figure 2.
foodElement.innerHTML += `<br>${favfood}`;

        //Remove the first element in the favorite food array.
favfood.shift();

        //Again, append the array output showing the modified array, using a line break as shown in step 5.5.
foodElement.innerHTML += `<br>${favfood}`;

        //Remove the last element in the favorite food array.
favfood.pop();

        //Append the array output with this final modified favorite foods array. Hint: Step 5.5.
foodElement.innerHTML += `<br>${favfood}`;
